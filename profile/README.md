Instant Private Crosschain Payments

## Problem Statement

Existing crypto payment solutions have these problems:

1. Bridging funds takes 5 to 10 mins.
2. User funds are fragmented across many L2s.
3. Existing stealth address protocols similar to zcash, zkbob, ERC-5564 require both sender and receiver to follow.

## Proposed Solution

1. Deposit in advance and spend later instantly.
2. User balance is global and not fragmented.
3. Generate stealth addresses on receiver side (instead of sender side) so that senders can use simple wallets like metamask.
