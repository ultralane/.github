Instant Private Crosschain Payments

## Problem Statement

Existing crypto payment solutions have these problems:

1. Bridging funds takes 5 to 10 mins.
2. User funds are fragmented across many L2s.
3. Existing stealth address protocols similar to zcash, zkbob, ERC-5564 require both sender and receiver to be using the same privacy application.

## Proposed Solution

1. Deposit in advance and spend later instantly.
2. User balance is global and not fragmented.
3. Private transfers work even if the sender is a normal metamask user.
